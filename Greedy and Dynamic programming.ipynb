If for the first child, $g_1>s_1$, then we have to move on to the cookie that could satisfy the first child; The same applies to the second child. Why is this the best case? Because if the cookies are assigned to anyone with high greediness, it can be assigned to the ones with low greediness without decreasing the total number of content children. Similarly, if one child is assigned with a large size satisfying his greediness, he could also be assigned with a smaller size cookie without decreasing the total number of content children."
